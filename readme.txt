Adds a load more option to the Query Loop Pagination block in Gutenberg, allowing users to load more posts without refreshing the page.

== Description ==

Adds a load more option to the Query Loop Pagination block in Gutenberg, allowing users to load more posts without refreshing the page.

To use this plugin, you must first add the Query Loop block into your post content, then add the Pagination block inside the Query Loop. When working with the Pagination block, you will see new options to enable load more on the block.

The load more option allows you to set a loading text parameter and also the button text. The load more button works with the alignment options and arrow options of the pagination block.

Here is how to enable the load more option:

* Add the Query Loop block to your post content.
* Inside the Query Loop block, add the Pagination block.
* In the Pagination block settings, enable the "Load More" option.
* Set the loading text parameter and the button text.
* Customize the alignment and arrow options if desired.
* That's it! Your visitors can now load more posts by clicking the load more button without refreshing the page.
